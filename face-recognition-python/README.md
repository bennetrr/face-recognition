# FaceRecognition

This script can detect and recognize faces in pictures. It's just an example i coded in python using [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition). This is only an experiment, the final version is coded in dotnet.

In this repo are two python files: `cliAPI.py` which uses the cli interface of Face Recognition. The file `pythonAPI.py` uses the python package provided by Face Recognition. I will not provide information how to use this because it's only an experiment :D
